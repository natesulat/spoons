#Spoons

##Lose friends with the click of a button!

Spoons is a game that combines all the competitiveness of musical chairs with all the cruelty of Monopoly, and is a surefire way to ruin every healthy relationship that you've ever developed.

The rules are simple:

1. All players are allowed up to four cards in their hand
2. The point of the game is to complete a set i.e. all four Jacks, or Queens, or Kings, etc.
3. One lucky guy or gal starts drawing cards and, if he/she doesn't want to keep them in her hand, passes them to the next player
4. Every player can pass an unwanted card to the next player in the circle. Passing cards is not turn-based; you can pass a card as soon as you receive it.
5. As soon as a player completes their hand (see rule 2), they can grab one of the spoons available. There is one fewer spoon than there are players.
6. Whoever didn't get a spoon is the loser. They have earned eternal shame.

The goal of this project is to be able to put yourself and your former friends through this hell without even having to be in the same room as them!
